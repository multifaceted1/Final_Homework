Goal:
Combining the html from the Server Client Connection Crud lesson (https://github.com/ccny-ss-js-dec-2020/class-16_02-23-21/tree/master/server-client-connection-crud/lesson) with passport,
create an app that will only let you see the dog breed crud html if you're signed in.

1. Everything will happen at the root route '/' in this application.
2. When you visit the root route and noone is logged in,
   you will only see the options to sign up or login
3. When someone eventually logs in, then when you visit the root route,
   You will see all of the HTML involved in the dog breed CRUD
4. Only when a user is logged in will they see the html for the dog breed CRUD
5. When someone logs out, then the root route will go back to showing the options
   to sign up or login.
